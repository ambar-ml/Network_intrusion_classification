# Network_intrusion_classification
It is a classification problem for ehich the data set has been taken from kaggle.

The aim is to classify for network intrusion and threats.

Two tasks are required to be performed:-

1. Binomial classification- To classify for normal or attack. Here first, important features have been selected out of the given features,then Vif has been used for multi-collinearity. After this, using final features various models have been trained and then the evaluation metrics have been checked.

2. Multinomial classification- To classify for threats for different categories. Here first, important features have been selected out of the given features,then Vif has been used for multi-collinearity. Afterwards sunce the class was highly imbalanced, we have Smote to balance the data. Afterwards various models have been trained and their evalutaion metrics have been compared
